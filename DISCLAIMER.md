Jarvis is an open-source fine-tuned language model (LLM) inspired by the fictional artificial intelligence system featured in the Iron Man movies. While Jarvis has been trained on a diverse dataset to facilitate its language generation capabilities, it is important to understand the following:

1. **Accuracy Limitations**: While Jarvis strives to provide accurate and helpful responses, it may not always be correct or up-to-date. Users should exercise discretion and verify information obtained from Jarvis before relying on it.

2. **No Legal or Financial Advice**: Jarvis is designed to be your AI assitant only and should not be considered a substitute for professional advice, especially in legal or financial matters. Users should consult appropriate professionals for specific advice tailored to their individual circumstances.

3. **Hallucinatory Responses**: Due to the nature of large language models, Jarvis may occasionally produce unrelated, false or hallucinatory responses. These responses should be disregarded and not taken seriously.

4. **Ethical Usage**: Users are responsible for ensuring that their interactions with Jarvis adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations. Jarvis should not be used for malicious purposes, spreading misinformation, or engaging in unethical activities.

5. **Privacy and Security**: While Jarvis does not store personal data or user interactions, users should exercise caution when sharing sensitive information. Open-source projects like Jarvis may have vulnerabilities, and users are encouraged to report any security concerns promptly.

6. **Continual Improvement**: Jarvis is an ongoing project, and updates may be made to improve its performance, accuracy, and functionality. Users are encouraged to provide feedback and contribute to its development through the appropriate channels.
